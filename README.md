This is a Blazor Web Application. 
Built with Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2022 (64-bit) - Version 17.12.3
DB - Sql Server Local DB.
Implemented MS Entity Framework to create ppiCandidateTestAppContext class to auto generate the schema. But may need to Double Click on connected services, Select ... and Add Migration for the ppiCandidateTestAppContext
to create the database initially. Then double click connected service and update Database. Then after the migration is done upon running the application, default entries will be added.
